**0 ERROR** (named after a [famous glitch in Generation
I](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/0_ERROR), while also alluding to flawless play)
[is](https://pkmn.cc/vaporware.png) a competitive Pokémon battling AI based on concepts from [state
of the art research](https://pkmn.ai) that aims to achieve superhuman performance with minimal
resource usage. 0 ERROR relies on EPOké's enhanced battle state tracking and prediction capabilities
to improve its perceived information set as well as an optimized battle simulation
[engine](https://github.com/pkmn/engine) to accelerate search and evaluation and enables offline
play in the [PocketMon](https://github.com/pkmn/PocketMon) client UI.
