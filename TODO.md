- testing code which runs agents against each other with various params to determine best params and effectiveness
- logic to allow someone to play against a bot
- multiple roots + join
- parallel (by definition has multiple roots!)
- stats to determine number of battles
- total moves:
  - singles:
    - gen 1-5: 5 switches + 4 moves = 9
    - gen 6-8 = 5 switches + 4 moves + 4 mega/z/max = 13
  - doubles:
    - gen 1-5: 4 switches + 3 switches + (4 moves x 4 targets) + (4 moves x 4 targets) = 39
    - gen 6-8: 7 + (16x2) + (16x2) = 71 (only gen 7, else 55)
- MCTS.update(action1, action2) => update root to advance game state by p1 and p2's moves
- handle `wait` = dont make searches!
- need to be able to play with player = 1 as `p1` or `p2`! = just multiply by -1
- simulation rollouts need to mutate instead of `toJSON` round tripping
