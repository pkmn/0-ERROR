This folder contains miscellaneous scripts and tools useful for working on 0 ERROR:

- [`logs.ts`](logs.ts): Processes data from
[compressed](https://github.com/pkmn/stats/blob/main/tools/compress) archives of Pokémon Showdown
battle logs into a compact binary format for a given generation:

      $ npm run compile && node build/tools/logs --gen=<GEN> --logs=<LOGS>

  The `LOGS` argument expects a directory containing logs archived in the following format:

      YYYY-MM.tar
      └── format
          └── YYYY-MM-DD.7z
              └── battle-format-N.log.json

  The script then writes a row for each log to standard out in the native-endian binary format
  detailed below:

  | Start | End    | Data                                                    |
  | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 0     | 8      | Number of milliseconds elapsed since the Unix epoch     |
  | 8     | 10     | Turns                                                   |
  | 10    | 11     | End Type (normal, tie, forfeit, forced win, forced tie) |
  | 11    | 13     | Winner's provisional Glicko-1 rating (`rpr`)            |
  | 13    | 14     | Winner's provisional Glicko-1 rating deviation (`rprd`) |
  | 14    | 16     | Loser's provisional Glicko-1 rating (`rpr`)             |
  | 16    | 17     | Losers's provisional Glicko-1 rating deviation (`rprd`) |
  | 17    | 17+N   | Winner's team (*encoding depends on generation*)        |
  | 17+N  | 17+2×N | Losers's team (*encoding depends on generation*)        |

  This resulting database can then be consumed by the `teams.ts` and `stats.ts` scripts detailed
  below.

- [`teams.ts`](teams.ts): Produces a `teams.db` file of the `NUM` (default 10,000) top teams from
`GEN` as found in the `LOGS` database (where the logs database is the output of `logs.ts`):

      $ npm run compile && node build/tools/teams compute --gen=<GEN> --logs=<LOGS> --num=<NUM?> > src/lib/gen<GEN>/data/teams.db

  The resulting binary `teams.db` can then be inspected with the same tool:

      $ npm run compile && node build/tools/teams display --gen=<GEN>

  The encoding of the team matches that of the teams stored in the `logs.db` and as such depends on
  the generation of the team in question:

- [`stats`](stats.ts): Produces a `stats.db` file based on weighted usage statistics from `GEN`
computed with rating `CUTOFF` from the `LOGS` database (where the logs database is the output of
`logs.ts`):

      $ npm run compile && node build/tools/stats compute --gen=<GEN> --logs=<LOGS> --cutoff=<CUTOFF> > src/lib/gen<GEN>/data/stats.db

    The  the `cutoff` subcommand takes a `PERCENTILE` and returns the weighting to use as a `CUTOFF`
    based on the distribution of ratings for the given `GEN` and `LOGS`.

      $ npm run compile && node build/tools/stats cutoff --gen=<GEN> --logs=<LOGS> --percentile=<PERCENTILE>

    The binary `stats.db` produced by `compute` can be inspected with the `display` subcommand,
    where `REPORT` can be either `pokemon` or `teammates`:

      $ npm run compile && node build/tools/stats display --gen=<GEN> --report=<REPORT>

    The `compute` and `display` commands require additional flags depending on the generation to
    determine how many moves/items/abilities etc to include in the `P(X | Species)` tables, though
    sensible defaults have been chosen already. To customize these, the  `sizes` subcommand can be
    used to gain insight into the data for a given `GEN` and `LOGS` so that these flags can then be
    passed to `compute` or `display`:

      $ npm run compile && node build/tools/stats sizes --gen=<GEN> --logs=<LOGS> --cutoff=<CUTOFF>

  The encoding of usage statistics data depends on the generation in question - check the
  `Statistics` data type definition in the respective `stats.zig` source file. At a high level, the
  following probabilities are computed:

  - `species_lead`: $P(Species | Lead)$, the probability that a given species was used in a leading
  - position
  - `species_nonlead`: $P(Species | \lnot Lead)$, the probability that a given species was used in
    a **non-leading** position. This is importantly different than Smogon's usage statistics where a
    Pokémon's usage statistics are agnostic to whether or not they were used as a lead (though the
    overall probability can still be calculated by combining the lead statistics and the non-lead
    statistics)
  - `move_species`:  $P(Move | Species)$, the probability for the top $M$ moves used by a species
    that the move is included in a Pokémon's set
  - `item_species`:  $P(Item | Species)$, in Generation II and onward, the probability for the top
    $I$ items used by a species that the item is included in a Pokémon's set
  - `ability_species`:  $P(Ability | Species)$, in Generation III and onward, the probability for the
    top $A$ abilities available to a species that the ability is included in a Pokémon's set

  Additionally, various "correlation deltas" are computed which are intended to be used to modify
  the base probabilities outlined above based on additional information revealed over the course of
  a battle:

  - `species_species`: $\Delta P(Species_B | Species_A)$, **TODO**
  - `move_move`: $\Delta P(Move_B | Move_A)$, **TODO**
  - `move_item`: $\Delta P(Move | Item)$, in Generation III[^1] and onwward, **TODO**
  - `move_ability`: $\Delta P(Move | Ability)$, in Generation III and onward, **TODO**
  - `item_ability`: $\Delta P(Item | Ability)$, in Generation III and onward, **TODO**
  - `ability_bias`: $\Delta P(Ability | Bias)$, in Generation III and onward, **TODO**
  - `item_bias`: $\Delta P(Item | Bias)$, in Generation III and onward, **TODO**
  - `move_bias`: $\Delta P(Move | Bias)$, in Generation III and onward, **TODO**

  Note that `stats.ts` is expected to deviate from the usage statistics computed from Smogon's
  official scripts even in places where they purport to measure the same thing:

  - Smogon chooses to elide some data from battles which it deems to have been too **'short'** (less
    than 3 turns in length)
  - Smogon uses a slightly more precise (but complex) approximation of the error function **`erf`**
  - subtly different floating point results due to the non commutative nature [**floating-point
    arithmetic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) and rounding schemes used
  - Smogon's "Teammate" statistics do not properly account for **`"empty"`** slots, skewing the
    denominator
  - Smogon assumes teams always contain 6 (the maximum) Pokémon instead of determining the actual
    average number of team members present

  [^1]: While items exist in Generation II, the `move_item` correlation is only considered in
  Generation III and onward as there isn't enough variety in viable items in Generation II to justify
  the overhead.

  TODO: correlations need to be done on a second pass because need all available options to be
  accounted for so that can figure out eg. which moves are present on a pokemon to be able to
  compute `move_move` and `move_ability`.
  TODO: footnote about backfilling in low percentage data
  with data from lower tiers and caveats (also, requires multiple input databases or a field
  indicating format)
