# Progression

TODO

- meta parameters with genetic programming/evoluationary algorithm
- storage = intrusive list, actions in nodes
- algorithm (MCTS vs. Expectiminimax)
  - parallelism
  - selection policy
    - random
    - UCT
    - EXP3
    - NN
  simulation policy
    - random
    - MAST (from tree vs. weighted from X(tree) + Y(sim)?)
    - NN (use for playout vs. weighted vs. skip playout)
  backpropagation policy
    - normal
    - weighted

---

opening (book?)
midgame (ISMCTS vs determinization)
endgame (Nash?/expectiminimax)

---

compare everything with and without perfect info (then mcts = determinization = root parallelsim)
